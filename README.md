# Antioverlay-addon
Hello! I created a small Antioverlay addon for FiveGuard that bans internal cheats even if they try to block input.

You can adjust how quickly it bans cheaters via the config.lua, but setting the values too low may cause false bans.
The config file is protected from dumpers (cheaters), so your Antioverlay settings remain secure.

I recommend not changing the OverlayKey since many cheaters rely on the default.

hope this addon helps you catch and ban cheaters on your server!
